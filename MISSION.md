# AudioList Mission

## Mission Statement

AudioList helps anyone buy great-sounding audio gear with confidence by turning objective measurements into simple letter-band scores and clear buying guidance.

Tagline: Audio can be easy.

## Product Direction

- Reduce decision overwhelm for everyday buyers.
- Put objective measurement quality first.
- Keep advanced technical detail available, but hidden by default.
- Answer three questions quickly: what to buy, how much to pay, and where to buy.

## Launch Focus (3 weeks)

- Primary categories: IEM, Headphones, DAC/Amp.
- UX priority: easy-to-follow buying guide before technical depth.
- Data priority: trustworthy measurements and reliable price handling.
- Trust priority: affiliate links never influence rankings.

## Scoring Model Decision

User-facing score presentation uses letter bands (S+ to F).

- S+, S, S-, A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F
- Rankings are measurement-based.
- Raw numeric scores remain internal for calculations, sorting, and filtering.

## Trust Principles

- Do not rank based on affiliate payout.
- Be explicit when data is missing, stale, or low confidence.
- Keep recommendations transparent and measurement-grounded.
